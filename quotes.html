	    <h1>Some of my favorite quotes of the novel To Kill a Mockingbird</h1>
	      <ol>
	        <li> “You never really understand a person until you consider things from his point of view … Until you climb inside of his skin and walk around in it.”</li>
	        <li> “Until I feared I would lose it, I never loved to read. One does not love breathing.”</li>
	        <li>“Shoot all the bluejays you want, if you can hit ‘em, but remember it’s a sin to kill a mockingbird.”</li>
	        <li>“People generally see what they look for, and hear what they listen for.”</li>
